*There are no QA awards for this audit.*

**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

### Audits
[Oak Security Audit Report](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/main/Nudge/2025-03-07%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Nudge%20Campaigns.pdf) - Published on March 7, 2025

Since the Oak Security Audit was completed, we have made the following 2 changes:

1. We added a function to rescue tokens (function rescueTokens(address token)). Without this function, if someone were to send tokens (other than the reward tokens) to a campaign contract, they would become stuck and therefore lost: Commit [23a8098f84d1100baee349be0f33344b68dccf2a](https://github.com/violetprotocol/nudge-smart-contracts/commit/23a8098f84d1100baee349be0f33344b68dccf2a).

2. We changed the logic for campaigns where the campaign admin does not want them to start immediately upon deployment. In this case, the address with the NUDGE_ADMIN_ROLE had to call setIsCampaignActive() to activate the campaign once the startTimestamp was reached. With the change introduced by Commit [e0fe46913140110ba6c1fa68a63c7a41a6dd4db2](https://github.com/violetprotocol/nudge-smart-contracts/commit/e0fe46913140110ba6c1fa68a63c7a41a6dd4db2), the campaign will automatically be turned "active" once the startTimestamp is reached by a call to handleReallocation(). Importantly, a campaign can still be set to active or inactive manually.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

### Solvency Invariants

1. Token Balance Integrity
- `rewardToken.balanceOf(campaign) >= pendingRewards + accumulatedFees`
- *Ensures the contract always maintains sufficient reward tokens to cover all pending rewards and accumulated fees.*
1. Protocol Solvency
- For any active participation p:`p.rewardAmount <= rewardToken.balanceOf(campaign) - (pendingRewards - p.rewardAmount) - accumulatedFees`
- *Guarantees that any individual user's reward can be fully covered by the contract's current token balance, after accounting for fees*

### State Consistency Invariants

1. Participation State Consistency
- State transitions only occur from `PARTICIPATING` ‚Üí `CLAIMED` or `PARTICIPATING` ‚Üí `INVALIDATED`
- Once in `CLAIMED` or `INVALIDATED` state, a participation cannot change state
1. Participation Tracking Consistency
- `sum(participations[i].toAmount for all i from 1 to pID) == totalReallocatedAmount` *Ensures the sum of all participation amounts matches the tracked total reallocated amount*
- pendingRewards == sum of all participation.rewardAmount where participation.status == PARTICIPATING
The pendingRewards value must equal the sum of reward amounts for all participations in the PARTICIPATING state.
- distributedRewards == sum of all participations.rewardAmount where participation.status == CLAIMED
    
    The distributedRewards value must equal the sum of reward amounts for all participations in the CLAIMED state.
    

### Claiming Rules Invariants

1. Claim Conditions
- User can only claim rewards for their own participations
- User can only claim rewards after holdingPeriodInSeconds has elapsed
- User can only claim rewards for participations in PARTICIPATING state
- User can only claim rewards for a participation once

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
We‚Äôll call any type of user of the protocol, a ‚Äúuser‚Äù (campaign administrators, end users a.k.a campaign participants, the Nudge team‚Ä¶), collectively referred as ‚Äúusers‚Äù.

Here are our main concerns in order from most critical to less critical:

- Loss of funds by any user.
- Accounting and calculation logic: a user receives significantly less, or more, tokens than they should.
- A campaign participant is able to claim rewards without fulfilling the conditions of the campaign. For example, claiming rewards before the end of the holding period.
- Loss of access and permissions granted to the Nudge team.
- Loss of access and permissions granted to the campaign administrator.
- A malicious actor gaining control to a functionality they shouldn‚Äôt have access to.
- Service halting (e.g denial of service attacks), rendering critical functionalities of the protocol unusable by users.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

We are using role-based access control in the protocol. Below are the roles that can be found, and how they will  be assigned initially:

- NUDGE_ADMIN_ROLE: This role is given to a multisig (Safe) wallet controlled by Nudge.
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: Similar to NUDGE_ADMIN_ROLE, initially.
- NUDGE_OPERATOR_ROLE: This role is given to one of our Relayers, submitting transactions programatically.
- SWAP_CALLER_ROLE: This role is initially given to one of Li.fi‚Äôs contracts (called Executor).
- CAMPAIGN_ADMIN_ROLE: This role is given to the administrator of a campaign. It is campaign-specific.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ using the template belowüëá

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner                          | Has superpowers                |
| Administrator                             | Can change fees                       |
